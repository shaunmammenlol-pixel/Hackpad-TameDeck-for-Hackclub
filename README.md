# Hackpad-TameDeck-for-Hackclub
It's basically a cheaper version of the steam deck which uses a raspberry pico.(much more cheaper and affordable) the code(thanks to gemini), and the case (designed by me) with the readme is all attached down here so please do go through it!..P.S, Pcb making is not done ive gone through the route of hand wiring all the anodes rather than custom pcb
